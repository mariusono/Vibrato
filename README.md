# Vibrato
A vibrato effect audio plug-in


The .vst3 is at Vibrato/Builds/MacOSX/build/Release/Vibrato.vst3 . Download it and put it in your default VST3 plugin folder ( for mac it usually is /Users/YOUR_USER/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3 . Before you open your DAW, right click on the .vst3 and click "open with". Choose a random program, it will not work anyway -- I open it with Adobe Acrobat Reader, and when promted with the "developer not recognized" window, click "Open". You'll probably get an error but it doesn't matter. Now you can open your DAW and hopefully when you rescan for plugins you will find it there.
